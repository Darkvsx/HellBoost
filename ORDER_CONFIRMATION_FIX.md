# Order Confirmation Fix

## Problem
Custom orders were redirecting to the order confirmation page with `orderId=undefined`, causing a "Order Not Found" error.

## Root Cause
In the checkout flow, the code was trying to access `customOrderItems[0].orderId` which doesn't exist. The `customOrderItems` are cart items, not order results.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Order ID Capture
**File**: `pages/checkout.tsx`
- Changed the custom order creation loop to capture the returned order ID
- Added variable `customOrderId` to store the first created custom order's ID
- Fixed the redirect logic to use the captured ID

### 2. Enhanced Order Confirmation Page
**File**: `pages/order-confirmation.tsx`
- Added fallback direct database query when order not found in hooks
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Better error handling for timing issues

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added fallback to account page if no order ID is available
- Better error messages and user feedback

## Code Changes

### Checkout Flow Fix:
```typescript
// Before (broken):
const customOrderId = customOrderItems.length > 0 ? customOrderItems[0].orderId : orderId;

// After (fixed):
let customOrderId = null;
const customOrderResult = await createCustomOrder({...});
if (!customOrderId && customOrderResult) {
  customOrderId = customOrderResult.id;
}
```

### Order Confirmation Fallback:
```typescript
// Added direct database query as fallback
const fetchOrderDirectly = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from(isCustomOrder ? "custom_orders" : "orders")
    .select("*")
    .eq("id", orderId)
    .single();
  // Handle result...
}
```

## Testing
- ✅ Custom order creation now properly captures order ID
- ✅ Order confirmation page receives valid order ID
- ✅ Fallback query works if hooks haven't updated yet
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ Graceful fallback to account page if all fails

## Files Modified
1. `pages/checkout.tsx` - Fixed order ID capture and redirect logic
2. `pages/order-confirmation.tsx` - Added fallback query and debug logging
3. `ORDER_CONFIRMATION_FIX.md` - This documentation

The "Order Not Found" issue should now be resolved for custom orders.
