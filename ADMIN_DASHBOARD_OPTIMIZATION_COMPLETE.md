## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Optimization

```
User Action → Optimistic Update → Background Sync → Cache Invalidation
     ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓
  Instant UI     Local State        API Request     Fresh Data
```

### Virtualization Strategy

```
Dataset Size → View Mode Selection → Component Loading
   < 50      →     Standard Table    →    Immediate
  50-100     →     Enhanced Table    →    Fast Load
   > 100     →    Virtualized View   →    Progressive
```

### Caching Hierarchy

```
Level 1: Component State (Immediate)
Level 2: React Query Cache (2-10 minutes)
Level 3: Optimistic Updates (Real-time)
Level 4: Background Sync (Continuous)
```
